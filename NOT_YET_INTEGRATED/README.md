reminderServerTest folder - An Eclipse Maven Project.  Inside docs/serverFiles are the files that should
be placed on the server.  Specific api keys and server ip addresses and user names have been removed.  The user must input their own info for their setup to the variables at the top of some of the files for it to run.  This includes generating a private key and adding the public key to the .ssh/authorized_keys file.
Note, for some email smtp hosts, like yahoo.com, you may need to allow signins from insecure apps
